# Distributed-Storage-System-for-Inventory-Management-Industry-4.0

# Problem Definition

* Manufacturing Companies now tend to automate and digitalize their enterprise and production processes.

* Digital integration of production facilities enables to get new information and useful knowledge about their processes in real time.

* Development of a software system for the management of inventory levels  which follows a distributed storage architecture to enable high flexibility and scalability to the inventory management system.

* Warehouse components to be represented as corresponding software components which can be integrated into the software system.

# Requirements

* Interfacing the scaling device with raspberry pi and parsing the data in specific data formats.

* Development of database containing the feature information of warehouse components 

* Developing the logic to identify the counts of warehouse components accurately based * on weight comparison.

* Setting up real time MQTT communication between the Raspberry Pi and the local machine.

* Implementing the dashboard to view the inventory levels of each warehouse component.

* Developing the user interface facility to add new warehouse component, select a component and delete an existing component.

* Development of a database for storing the inventory log information.

* Storing the inventory log information  into the database as per user input.

* Utility to delete and download the inventory log information  on user input.

* Several approaches to identify article weight mismatch.
